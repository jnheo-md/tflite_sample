# Sample code for using tflite model
Originally created for a lecture at Department of Radiology, Seoul National University Hospital. This is a sample code that uses a custom-built tflite model (which is a binary image classifier) and outputs a prediction value from user-selected image file.

# Getting Started

## Setup Flutter (by Flutter team)
A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Setup tflite_flutter
This sample uses tflite_flutter package. This packages requires platform-specific setup, which can be found at :
https://pub.dev/packages/tflite_flutter

## Converting your ML model into a .tflite model
The pre-existing model should be converted to a tflite(tensorflow-lite) model. The following is one of many tutorials on converting your model into a tflite model.
